            <p>What Brazilian Jiu-jitsu gave me was the perfect outlet.
            It&apos;s an ever-changing puzzle with so many different pieces. It forces you to bring everything you have to bear.
            You have to use your mind, body and spirit to excel at this art, and all are strengthened in the process.
            It&apos;s simply problem solving in its finest form.
            You have to learn how they interact with each other.
            What makes it challenging and fascinating is that the puzzle isn&apos;t two-dimensional. There is no one true
            solution. Each piece doesn&apos;t have a clearly defined space that it must fit into.
            Instead, the puzzle is multidimensional.</p>

            <p>For example, one concept can be linked to many different movements to create a diverse range of techniques.
            The same can be said about linking movements to concepts.
            Then on the next level, there is how techniques interact with each other. You have to figure out how to use them
            in combination to form effective attack sequences and loops.
            You can&apos;t forget to add resistance to the equation either. So there are counters, re-counters, reversals, and
            escapes. It can all get quite complex, but there is a certain simplicity to it as well.</p>

            <p> BJJ can be safely practiced under conditions of 100 percent resistance and, therefore, any doubts or illusions
            about its effectiveness can be removed. Striking-based arts can also be performed under full resistance, of
            course, but not safely because getting repeatedly hit in the head is bad for your health. And, whatever the
            intensity of training, it is difficult to remove uncertainty from the strikers art: Not even a professional
            boxer can be sure what will happen if he hits an assailant squarely on the jaw with a closed fist. The other man
            might fall to the ground unconscious, or he might not and without gloves, the boxer might break his hand on the
            first punch. By contrast, even a novice at BJJ knows beyond any doubt what will happen if he correctly applies a
            triangle choke. It is a remarkable property of grappling that the distance between theory and reality can be
            fully bridged. </p>

            <p>I can now attest that the experience of grappling with an expert is akin to falling into deep water without
            knowing how to swim. You will make a furious effort to stay afloat and you will fail. Once you learn how to
            swim, however, it becomes difficult to see what the problem is why cant a drowning man just relax and tread
            water? The same inscrutable difference between lethal ignorance and lifesaving knowledge can be found on the
            mat: To train in BJJ is to continually drown or, rather, to be drowned, in sudden and ingenious ways and to
            be taught, again and again, how to swim. </p>

            <p>To study BJJ for self-defense, therefore, is to prepare for the worst-case scenario but the worst case remains
            a high probability in any sudden encounter with violence. If you are ever attacked by a bigger, stronger person,
            there is a very good chance you will find yourself on the ground, wrestling in some form. The difference between
            knowing what to do in this situation and merely relying on your primate intuitions is as impressive a gap
            between knowledge and ignorance as I have ever come across.</p>

            <p>"I do it because it&apos;s hard. Because it&apos;s the hardest thing I&apos;ve ever done. And because it never ends. Every
            day presents me with a series of problems that I spend the rest of the day thinking about how I might solve
            or at least chip away at. Next day same. And the day after that."
